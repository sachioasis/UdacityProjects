			<ul id="facts">
              <li><span><b>Scientific Name</b></span>: Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</li>
				<li><span><b>Average Length</b></span>: 106 to 134 centimeters</li>

			<p id="summary">The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over hair.</p>
